# EaglerLink
Lightweight custom-domain bridge for Eaglercraft hosts (like EaglerHost) that can’t change domains. Deploy on Render (or similar) to serve the portal from /public and proxy WSS to your upstream. Players connect via wss://yourdomain.com while your original eagler.host backend stays the same.
